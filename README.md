# 🚀 Automation Project - File Organizer

This Python script **automatically organizes files** in a specified folder by sorting them into subfolders based on their file extensions.

## 📌 Features
✅ Scans a directory and categorizes files  
✅ Moves files into folders based on extension (e.g., `.pdf` → `PDF/`, `.jpg` → `JPG/`)  
✅ Creates folders automatically if they don’t exist  
✅ Simple to use and fully automated  

## 📜 How It Works
1. The script **checks a folder** for files.

3. It **moves files into the correct folders** based on extension.
